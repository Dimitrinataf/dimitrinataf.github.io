I have no idea how to start with this. So I think I’ll go ahead and tell you a short story that will explain how I am, and why I think it would be interesting to share it. What I’m going for here&amp;hellip; is that if you start to look at food in a similar way to me, and if you end up going on food adventures like I do, well &amp;ndash; I’d be absolutely honored.</description></item><item><title>My uni-que experience</title><link>https://dimitrinataf.com/post/bushwick-copper-mug-offal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dimitrinataf.com/post/bushwick-copper-mug-offal/</guid><description>Believe it or not, but growing up I REFUSED to eat raw fish - mainly sushi(I can’t think of a single thing I don’t eat nowadays, besides herring&amp;hellip; don’t ask). So can you imagine my disgust when my mom would go on her regular excursions into the sea and come out with sea urchin(uni), open it up in front of us, SCOOP OUT ITS EGGS, AND EAT THEM?!?!
Well&amp;hellip; 15 years later - I can’t get enough of sushi, and a must- do for me when I’m back on the island and for anyone who comes to visit me, is to go on a Uni-excursion.</description></item></channel></rss>
